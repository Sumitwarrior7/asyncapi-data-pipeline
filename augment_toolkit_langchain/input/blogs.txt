As the saying goes,"The second time is a charm."AsyncAPI Conf on Tour returned in 2024 for a set of events across different locations. Not only did we run in-person conferences, but we also brought back our beloved online conference this time around, making the whole experience complete.In the AsyncAPI Conf on Tour 2023, I mentioned a few things I would love to improve; let's see what we changed, the challenges we faced, and what we are changing as we advance.Planning ProcessAfter a successful partnership with the APIdays Paris event, they offered to sponsor a track at other events they were hosting. Given the positive outcome in Paris, we were eager to explore the options. We decided to hold three in-person events with APIdays as our venue and host sponsor.Later in the year, I thought it would be a great idea to bring back the online conference to provide an opportunity for those who can't travel but still want to speak and share their expertise. This idea completed the entire experience, bringing the total number of events to four.For a detailed summary of what happened at each event, please read the following summaries:AsyncAPI Conference HelsinkiAsyncAPI Conference LondonAsyncAPI Online ConferenceAsyncAPI Conf in ParisChallengesThe first challenge we faced was that most of the conferences were held in Europe this time, and for many, obtaining a Schengen visa isn't an easy process.Secondly, although we have a venue and host sponsor, we still need financial support to cover costs such as shipping swags and providing travel funding for speakers.AttendanceWe had an incredible turnout for all our in-person events. The highlight was networking with community members, ambassadors, and friends at the APIs Standards booth. This booth became a hub for discussions with various companies and experts while maintaining vendor neutrality.Over580people attended our in-person conference, and we had more than450views during our AsyncAPI Online Conference livestream. Additionally, the recorded sessions received over446views after the conference.You can also catch up on therecordings from the AsyncAPI Online Conference.Conference SponsorsAACoT'24 was possible thanks toAPIdays, our Event Host and Sponsor. They not only provided a venue to host the conferences and sponsored us for lunch, breakfast, and refreshments, but we also had anAPI Standardsbooth.I want to thank our financial sponsors,Gravitee.ioandPostman, for supporting the conference. Thanks to their sponsorship, I traveled to London to support the event in person.
Additionally, we were able to provide partial assistance to speakers at the Paris conference and covered the logistics of swag shipment.Special Shout OutFirstly, my gratitude goes out to all the speakers for dedicating their time to share their expertise and provide valuable insights to the community.Secondly, I want to thank all the community members who volunteered at the API Standards booth during the conference. Your commitment to sharing knowledge with attendees is greatly appreciated and does not go unnoticed.Lastly, I am genuinely thankful for their hard work and commitment to assisting me behind the scenes. They led and contributed to the aspects that made the conference successful and even being a courier so that we could have materials and set up the booth tables.Lukasz GornickiAzeez ElegbedeBarbara Czy≈ºKhuda Dad NomaniAishat MuibudeenOluwabamikemi KayodeAshmit JagtapWhere To In 2025?For AsyncAPI Conference 2025, we are excited to announce thatAPIdayswill be hosting us in:Singapore onthe 15th - 16th of April.Munich onthe 2nd - 3rd of July.London onthe 22nd - 24th of September.Paris onthe 9th -11th of December.APIConf Lagoswill be hosting us in Lagos, Nigeria, onthe 18th - 19th of July.We will also have our annual AsyncAPI Online Conference onthe 29th of October.We are looking for financial sponsors, and if you know any company that will be interested,please download and share our conference sponsorship prospectus.
